Overview
========
All the different dataset 3D structures are in the sdf file. The experimental pIC50 values for each dataset are in the excel file.
The pIC50 values were converted to delta G values as well. The experiment binding affinity (delta G) files is in the exp folder in the similar order of ligand arranged in the each sdf file.

Data Overview
=============

Explain where the data came from and it's specific path so it's easy to find. Also not any nomenclature you need to clarify to any user using the data to reduce confusion.

Data Collection
===============

- `SDF` the sdf files were abstracted from where
- `DAT` which software was the dat files produced.
